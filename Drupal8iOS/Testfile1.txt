C basics
=======================
>	Local variables have more preference over global variables.
>	Functional parameter or Formal parameter are treated as Local variable for function body so they have more preferences over global variables.

>  Initialisation  <<<
>	Local variables are not initialised by system but Global variables are initialised by system as follow

	Data Type 		|	Initial Default Value
	int		        |	0
	char			|	'\0'
	float			|	0.0
	double			|	0.0
	pointer 		|	NULL
	
> It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly otherwise, your program may produce unexpected results
  because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at its memory location.
> In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated staticallyâ€”whose lifetime or "extent" extends 
  across the entire run of the program. This is in contrast to the more ephemeral automatic variables (local variables are generally automatic),\
  whose storage is allocated and deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects whose storage is dynamically allocated in heap memory.
  
> A static function can only be accessed inside the file which has declared it.
> Static variables are auto-initialised  as global variables.
> Static variables can only be initialised with constant expressions.
> Static variables should be initialised before main().
> if static is used within the function then variable will be alive through out the program but
  if it is used in global way then other file which is linked with this file will not be able to access it.

> Normally, the compiler determines what data is to be stored in the registers of the CPU at what times.
  However, the C language provides the storage class register so that the programmer can ``suggest'' 
  to the compiler that particular automatic variables should be allocated to CPU registers
  if possible. Thus, register variables provide a certain control over efficiency of program execution. 
  Variables which are used repeatedly or whose access times are critical, may be declared 
  to be of storage class register.
> Address of register variable cannot be determined in any way.



> Extern Keyword
 It extends visibility of variables and functions in C. In C by default 'extern' key word
 is present in declaration or definition.
	
 Actually for C variables to declare  only  is 
						'extern int a;'
 With out extern it will allocate memory for it.
 Extern will also increases scope of variable so it can be accessed in other file also.
 use extern key word before main starts. -- advise
